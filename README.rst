Description
----------------
Python implementation of a Hidden Markov Model.  This was created following
the description and pseudo-code in Jurafsky, D., Martin, J. (2000).  *Speech
and Language Processing: An Introduction to Natural Language Processing,
Computational Linguistics, and Speech Recognition*, 2nd Ed.  Pearson/Prentice
Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, pp. 176-192.  Like J&M, my code has built in a
test/demo case modelling the ice-cream diary of Jason Eisner in his* Interactive
Spreadsheet for Teaching the Forward-Backward Algorithm* (2002).  I also used
this code to tag sequences of words with parts of speech for a Natural Language
Processing course, though this implementation does not handle unknown
observations.
